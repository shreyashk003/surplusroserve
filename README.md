# surplusroserve
In order to connect businesses with excess food to non-profits that may repurpose it for the underprivileged, the project intends to develop a digital platform (dashboard/mobile app). The platform helps NGOs fight food hunger and tackles the problem of food waste in the restaurant business. The proposed solution aims to optimize the detection and allocation of surplus food, leading to effective redistribution.

Method for Identifying Issues:-
Restaurant Food Waste: Draw attention to the significant amount of food waste produced by eateries.
Restraints on NGO Resources: In order to sustain their goals, NGOs have challenges in obtaining sufficient food supplies.
Ineffectiveness of Current Procedures: Draw attention to the inefficiencies and labor-intensive process of coordinating restaurant surplus food with non-governmental organizations.

The programming language used to build are-
*HTML
*CSS
*JQUERY
*JAVASCRIPT
*MONGODB

#FRONTEND-
>HTML
>CSS

#BACKEND-
>JAVASCRIPT
 
#Database
>MongoDB

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. You can create the database foodRedistribution and the collections surpluses and requests manually or let the application create them when it first runs.

Running the Application
Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine or change the MongoDB connection string to your MongoDB server.
Install the necessary Node.js packages:
npm install express mongoose body-parser cors
Start the Node.js server:
node server.js
Open index.html in your browser to access the frontend.
This setup provides a basic structure for your project. You can expand it by adding authentication, advanced error handling, better UI/UX, and more complex logic for handling multiple NGO requests.
